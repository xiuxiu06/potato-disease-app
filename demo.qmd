## Application Demo

This demo video shows the potato disease detection app running on localhost. Since the backend API is not deployed yet, this demonstrates how the application works locally during development.

## About This Demo
This video shows the application running on localhost during development. The backend will be deployed in the future to make the live version available online.

## What the Demo Shows

The video demonstrates the complete workflow:

1. **Image Upload**: User selects a potato leaf image
2. **Processing**: React frontend sends image to FastAPI backend
3. **Model Prediction**: TensorFlow CNN model analyzes the image
4. **Results**: Displays disease classification (Early Blight, Late Blight, or Healthy)

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React with Material-UI for clean interface
- **Backend**: FastAPI serving the TensorFlow model
- **Model**: CNN trained on PlantVillage dataset
- **Features**: Drag-and-drop upload, real-time results
