## Project Overview

This is a simple machine learning project that demonstrates a potato disease detection system. The project includes:

- A **CNN model** trained on the PlantVillage dataset
- A **FastAPI backend** that serves the model
- A **React frontend** for uploading images
- **Documentation** created with Quarto

## What This Project Shows

This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Build end-to-end ML applications
- Create REST APIs with FastAPI
- Develop React frontends
- Document projects professionally with Quarto
- Work with TensorFlow/Keras
